# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Product Overview
- **Product Name:** DSL Parser
- **Document Version:** 1.0
- **Author:** [Your Name]
- **Date:** [Creation Date]
- **Revision History:**
  - 1.0 - [Date] - Initial draft

## 2. Executive Summary
The DSL Parser is designed to interpret and process a custom Domain-Specific Language, converting DSL scripts into executable code or data structures. This facilitates the development of applications by providing a streamlined and efficient means of defining domain-specific behavior and configurations.

## 3. Objectives
- **Accurate Parsing:** Ensure the parser correctly interprets the DSL syntax and semantics.
- **Extensibility:** Design the parser to accommodate future extensions or modifications to the DSL.
- **Performance:** Optimize parsing operations to handle large scripts efficiently.
- **Error Handling:** Provide clear and informative error messages to aid in debugging DSL scripts.
- **Integration:** Enable seamless integration with existing development environments and toolchains.

## 4. Background
Domain-Specific Languages offer tailored solutions for specific problem domains, enhancing productivity and reducing errors. A robust parser is critical for translating DSL scripts into actionable components within software applications.

## 5. Scope
- **In Scope:**
  - Development of the core parsing engine.
  - Implementation of syntax and semantic analysis.
  - Error detection and reporting mechanisms.
  - Integration interfaces for embedding the parser into other systems.
- **Out of Scope:**
  - Development of a DSL editor or IDE.
  - Execution engine for the parsed output.
  - Detailed design of the DSL syntax and grammar.

## 6. User Personas
- **Language Developers:** Individuals defining and evolving the DSL syntax and semantics.
- **Application Developers:** Programmers utilizing the DSL to build domain-specific applications.
- **Quality Assurance Engineers:** Testers ensuring the parser's correctness and reliability.

## 7. User Stories
- *As a* **Language Developer**, *I want to* define new syntax rules *so that* the DSL can evolve to meet emerging requirements.
- *As an* **Application Developer**, *I want to* receive clear error messages when my DSL script contains mistakes *so that* I can debug efficiently.
- *As a* **Quality Assurance Engineer**, *I want to* run a suite of test cases against the parser *so that* I can verify its accuracy and robustness.

## 8. Functional Requirements
- **Syntax Analysis:** The parser shall tokenize and analyze the DSL scripts to ensure they conform to defined grammar rules.
- **Semantic Analysis:** The parser shall validate the meaning and context of the DSL scripts to ensure logical consistency.
- **Error Reporting:** The parser shall provide detailed error messages indicating the type and location of syntax or semantic errors.
- **Extensibility:** The parser shall allow for the addition of new syntax rules without significant refactoring.

## 9. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance:** The parser should process scripts containing up to 10,000 lines within 2 seconds.
- **Scalability:** The parser architecture should support concurrent parsing operations.
- **Usability:** The parser should offer a straightforward API for integration into development environments.
- **Maintainability:** The codebase should follow best practices to facilitate ease of maintenance and future enhancements.

## 10. Assumptions and Constraints
- **Assumptions:**
  - The DSL grammar will be well-defined and stable during the initial development phase.
  - Users have a basic understanding of the DSL syntax and usage.
- **Constraints:**
  - The parser will be implemented in [Chosen Programming Language].
  - Compliance with [Relevant Standards or Protocols] is required.

## 11. Dependencies
- **Third-Party Libraries:** Utilization of existing parsing libraries or frameworks, if applicable.
- **Development Tools:** Integration with specific IDEs or build systems as required.
- **External Systems:** Interfaces with other components or services that consume the parser's output.

## 12. Acceptance Criteria
- Successful parsing of valid DSL scripts with correct output generation.
- Accurate detection and reporting of errors in invalid DSL scripts.
- Demonstrated performance benchmarks meeting the specified requirements.
- Positive feedback from initial user testing regarding usability and integration.

## 13. Success Metrics
- **Accuracy Rate:** Percentage of DSL scripts parsed without errors.
- **Performance Metrics:** Average time taken to parse scripts of varying sizes.
- **User Satisfaction:** Feedback scores from developers and stakeholders.
- **Adoption Rate:** Number of projects or systems integrating the DSL parser.
